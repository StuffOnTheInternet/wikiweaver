# WikiWeaver

Wikiweaver makes spectating wikiraces a lot more interesting.
It visualises every page a player visits as a node.

## Deployment

The application can currently only be deployed to my domain `lofen.tplinkdns.com`.
If you want to use another domain, find all the appropriate locations in the code and changes them accordingly.
You will also need to get a signed private key for https to work.
It is deployed with `docker-compose up --build`.
